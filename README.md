# GO-Skeleton

This skeleton inspired from [wild-workouts-go-ddd-examole](https://github.com/ThreeDotsLabs/wild-workouts-go-ddd-example)

## Need to Install
    - install yq (https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq/v3.x)

## Notes
    - sugar log only print stack trace to where the log is triggered, will not good for decorator log cased, need to find one that can trace error better. (try zerolog later.)
